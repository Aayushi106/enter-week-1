# Water Quality Prediction
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.
# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
