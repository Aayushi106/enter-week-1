# Water Quality Prediction
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.
# Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas, NumPy – Data handling
3. Scikit-learn – Machine learning model and evaluation
4. Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization
5. Jupyter Notebook – Interactive experimentation
